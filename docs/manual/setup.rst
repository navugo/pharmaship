Setup your inventory
--------------------

When you install from scratch, and need to configure your database, before entering any medicines in there, you first
need to configure your location, the shelve and drawer names you will use to tell to pharmaship where are stored your medical stuffs.

.. note:: Be explicit there as finding medicines is always a kind of rush.

Configure your locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In any software window, open *Configuration Menu* then *Location Manager*.

By default, there is few locations. You may modify, add, remove others location, but it is a good habit to keep these first locations.

Let's make an example. If we want to add the desktop drawer in our list of locations, because we store medical tools
there, simply click on *new location* button, located either in the top right corner, either in the bottom left corner
of the window. On the sub window which opens, select **hospital** as *parent* location, for a drawer in hospital, and
put a name, like **Desk Drawer**. Click on *Add the location*.

Now it has been added, you can see that it appears in the list of locations - lucky we are !
We can easily delete, or modify it with the button on the right end of its line, and to update, it appears exactly on
the same way. To erase, click on the cross button, then validate on the sub window.

Once all your locations are set up, you may proceed with updates of medicines.
