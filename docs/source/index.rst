======================================
Welcome to PharmaShip's documentation!
======================================

.. |ps| replace:: *PharmaShip*

|ps| is a project from `DSM <http://www.devmaretique.com>`_ born from the lack of software to manage medicine spares, communication between ship and medical centers (CCMM [#]_ in France) and requisitions.

|ps| is designed to:

* manage medicine inventory;
* manage medical material;
* import inventory (flag regulation);
* update stock according to the inventory by law;
* manage and edit medicine and material requisition;
* page of contact of *Purpan*.

In the next version, you will have also documentation and easy to use cheat sheet for medicines and materials.

Please, find below the user manual for this application:
